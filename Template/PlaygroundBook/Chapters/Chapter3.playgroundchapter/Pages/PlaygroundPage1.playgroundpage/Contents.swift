 ## Making our goalkeeper smarter
 
Look who showed up! We have a goalkeeper in our game now.

However he doens't do much yet. Except for standing still in the middle of the goal üòÜ.
 
But once more, this is not a problem for us. Soon we will fix it.
 
## Artificial intelligence
 
Nowadays, is it very common for games to adopt some kind of Artifitial Inteligence (AI). The reason is because it makes our games more fun and challenging.
 
After all, what would be the fun of playing a game without a challenge?

In our game this is no different. It's still very easy to make goals.
 
Therefore, what we're going to now is add some intelligence to our goalkeeper.
 
## Actions

 Our intelligence will be based on actions. Actions can be many things like, for example, moving, hiding, following a path, repeating some other action... Anyway, I think you've got the ideia.
 
For our goalkeeper we will initially create a very simple action. He will walk a path from one end of the goal to the other.
 
For this we will add the following method below, passing the initial position of our goalkeeper and the time in which we want that action to be performed.
 
 Once this is done, click in Run code.*/
